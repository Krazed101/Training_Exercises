## EXERCISE 1

### Chat Server

#### Requirements

1. Must have a server and client that can talk between each other.
  - One needs to be in Python and the other in C
2. The server should be able to handle multiple clients at one time.
3. The server should take the message from one client and sent to all others.

#### Tips

- Start small with just a server and client. Once that works start upgrading.
- Use Select to handle multiple clients at one time.
- DON'T stack overflow everything!
